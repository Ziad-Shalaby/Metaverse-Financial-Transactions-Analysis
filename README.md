# App Behavior Analysis Project:

Gain insights into user interactions with financial applications.
This project analyzes behavioral data from financial application users to uncover trends and patterns that can help optimize user experience and engagement. By applying clustering algorithms and visualization techniques, the analysis provides a comprehensive understanding of user behavior.

Key Features:

- Data preprocessing: Handling timestamps, renaming columns, and correcting data types.
- Application of clustering methods like K-Medoids and hierarchical clustering.
- Interactive visualizations using Seaborn, Matplotlib, and Plotly for deeper insights.
- Identification of behavioral patterns to inform application optimization strategies.
